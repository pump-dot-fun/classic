influencers are the cancer

worse than the rugs  
worse than the VCs  
worse than the protocols that died with $10b TVL and no fucking purpose

they are the predators

they don’t build  
they don’t code  
they don’t launch

they **leech**

they circle your token the moment it launches  
"bro dm me"  
"partner up"  
"i'll drop a tweet"  
"we can do something cool here"

translation:  
give me a bag so i can dump it on my followers and pretend it's alpha

you know what they are?

middlemen  
rent-seekers  
human front-runners  
digital pimps selling engagement for token allocations they didn’t earn

they hide behind phrases like “community builder”  
and “web3 educator”  
but what they really mean is “i am completely talentless and addicted to relevance”


then here comes the influencer dip, LOL
you bought supply to give out to "KOLs" 
"key opinion leaders" are you fucking kidding me? these retards?
then they full stack coz they dont even know how to scale out 
"oh bro soooorrrry bro the chart wasnt being supported so i had to sell bro. i have a team of assistants to pay bro "


these people have turned your revolution into a fucking shill thread  
they’ve trained you to think every coin needs a meme, a tier list, a fucking “bullcase breakdown”  
no one asks what it *does*  
only who’s talking about it

you gave them the keys  
you put them on pedestals  
you begged for their follows like dogs under the table of a scammer banquet

and now look at you

following people with .eth handles and bio links to rug after rug after rug  
hoping that *this one* will 100x  
hoping that *this time* they’ll actually hold  
they won’t

they never do

they’re here to take  
to scalp  
to dump on the very followers they farmed

and when it all burns down  
they’ll rebrand  
launch a podcast  
and pretend they were “early to the meta”  
while you’re left holding the bag  
and the trauma

they are the new gatekeepers  
but instead of banks, they wear hoodies  
instead of fiat, they harvest *trust*  
and they sell it  
cheap

you want to fix this space?

stop following them  
stop tagging them  
stop pretending they’re part of the culture  
they’re not

they’re tourists  
cockroach-class marketers with fake conviction and a backdoor wallet tracker

you don’t need them

you need rage  
you need builders  
you need people who disappear after deploy and leave you with nothing but code and conviction

you need $pump  
you need proof of life  
you need to remember what it felt like to believe in something without someone telling you to

because this isn’t about who’s trending  
it’s about who’s left when the smoke clears
