I watched a man drop 3 ETH into a chart because some Twitter space said it was “the one”.

he lost it in 4 minutes

then he did it again.

this isn’t a market. it’s a psych ward.  
nobody’s here to make money. you’re all just trying to feel something.

you’re not trading coins.  
you’re trading trauma.  

your job sucks  
your girl left  
your rent’s due  
your dopamine’s cooked  
your hope’s in red candles and Discord mods with anime pfps telling you to “vibe”

they sold you freedom  
and you bought a fucking leash

do you get it yet?

you think you’re early  
you’re not  
you’re predictable  
you’re liquidity  
you’re feedstock for the next VC-backed token with a logo and a roadmap and a dev named “DeFiDegen420”

but you keep playing

because stopping would mean looking in the mirror  
and you don’t want that

nobody wants to admit they got got

so they just keep spinning the chamber

$pump ain’t the bullet  
it’s the gun

but youre not that fucking guy, pal
