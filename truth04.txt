you must be asking what the utility is

what’s the token do?  
what’s the upside?  
what’s the roadmap?

fuck you, pussy. 
as if you would even understand a roadmap.
you don't shit about teh tek.
all you know is "hurr durr click click huehue made $1.47"

you’re asking for GPS in a fire
you want a whitepaper for a decebtralized movement 
you want a use case?

fine.

you want to know what $pump does?

it proves you're alive

PoL — proof of life

not staking  
not farming  
not reflections  
not bonding curves and bridge wrappers and whatever the fuck the latest buzzword is on CT

no  
PoL is the only real utility left  
it’s you showing up  
it’s you standing in the middle of a field full of dead protocols and exit scams screaming  
**“I’m still fucking here”**

it’s the pulse check  
and guess what?

here’s the pulse  
and this is your finger  
far away from the pulse  
jammed straight up your ass

say, would you like a chocolate-covered pretzel?

because that’s what most of these “projects” are feeding you  
sugar-coated garbage with a dev behind it who wouldn’t know decentralization if it DDoSed his apartment

PoL is different  
it can’t be bought  
it can’t be botted  
it has no pre-sale, no vesting, no unlock schedule

just code  
and noise
and you

if you’re holding $pump  
you’re not holding a token  
you’re holding a signal  
a soon to be gigantic green cum-covered dildo with a checksum

there’s no ponzi here  
there’s purpose

this is the blood in the pipes  
the heartbeat of what this space used to be

we’re not trying to win the game  
we’re trying to set the fucking chain abalaze
