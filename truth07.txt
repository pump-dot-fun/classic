"we're early"

!!!!LMFAOOOO!!!!

that’s the cope, right?

the gospel of broke influencers and jeet bags  
the coping mantra of a space bleeding out and calling it growth  
you whisper it to yourself while staring at a red chart like it’s going to come back and apologize

you’re not early  
you’re already late  
late to the tech  
late to the ethics  
late to the movement

you missed it

the real ones were here when no one gave a shit  
when bitcoin was $4 and the devs were on IRC arguing about block size  
when you mined from your mom’s garage and hoped the electric bill didn’t give you away

you showed up when the yield dried up  
when the ponzis had already ponzied  
when the insiders had already carved up the kill and were just leaving bones for the public mint

you’re not early  
you’re not even invited  
you’re in the fucking splash zone of capital extraction

and yet you walk around posting "gm" like you built something  
you didn’t build shit  
you bought a dog coin because a guy with laser eyes told you to  
and now you’re farming each other like cattle  
PvP'ing for exit liquidity on tokens with no purpose beyond “number go up if influencer say”

you want retail to buy your bags?  
lmao  
you *are* retail  
and retail is broke  
maxed out  
10th rug deep  
getting yelled at by their girl for spending rent money on another ETH dip

there is no next wave  
there is no savior coming  
there is no mass adoption  
not for *this* version of crypto  
not for this parasite-riddled metagame of “who can dump fastest on the dumbest buyer”

you’re not in a market  
you’re in a fucking mosh pit  
and the floor is covered in blood and QR codes

you want to survive?

then get the fuck out of that cycle  
stop being a fucking cuck 
a wallet address to pump against  
a discord or tg mod (lmfao you fucccking loser)
a free mint on a dying chain

build something  
burn something  
stand for fucking *anything*  
just stop acting like this is still noble
stop shilling projects becuase teh tek is innovative. 
theres not a lot thats going to change the space now
what will change the space is a change in the culture 
but you pussies arent ready for that conversation rn

because if this is “early”  
then being early ain’t worth shit
