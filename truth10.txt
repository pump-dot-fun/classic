you were never decentralized

you were just unsupervised  
for a little while

and you mistook that for freedom

your token?  
deployed by a bunch of trendy crossbody wearing  "cabal" faggots  
your DAO?  
votes on Snapshot and begs multisig holders to “execute”  
your LP?  
owned by the same people who tweeted “burn it all down” last cycle  
your chain?  
governed by 21 nodes, 14 of which know each other and brunch together

this isn’t decentralization  
it’s a larp  
it’s cosplay for cowards  
it’s a skin suit stitched together from whitepapers you never read

decentralized?  
you’re using an RPC hosted on Infura  
you’re bridging through a frontend run by a Delaware LLC  
you’re verifying contracts through Etherscan and calling it “trustless”  
you’re tweeting from a blue-check wallet linked to your real name and your fucking home IP
its honesrly fucking pathetic just how on the radar you really are 

you were never decentralized  
you were just early enough that nobody noticed

but now they do  
and they’re coming  
not with tanks  
with forms  
with compliance dashboards  
with subpoenas  
with “grants” and “public goods funding” that funnel your rebellion straight into the fucking IMF’s GitHub

you let the fox in  
because he said “wen airdrop?” in lowercase and had a monkey pfp and your dopamine addicted brain thought "haha so relatable"

you let the suits in  
because they hired “anon” devs and launched on Solana and pretended they weren’t Goldman Sachs interns six months ago

you let the state in  
because you were too horni for volume to notice the KYC checkboxes and wallet blacklists

so here we are  
on a chain owned by platforms  
traded by bots  
influenced by pussies   
governed by VCs  
and worshipped by broke gamblers pretending it’s a movement

you want decentralization?  
you better start deploying  
you better start vanishing  
you better start refusing to explain yourself

because they don’t need your permission  
just your participation

and you’ve been giving it away  
every time you mint  
every time you like  
every time you connect wallet and smile like a good little serf


crypto isnt a weekend convention 
its not getting the VIP pass
its not after parties with other faggots holding JPEGs that look like yours


you thought you were escaping
but you're more wired in than ever

you were never decentralized  
but maybe  
just maybe  
you can still become ungovernable
