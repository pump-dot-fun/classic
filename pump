<span class="comment">/**Crypto is broken.
Not because of pump.fun and solana jeets, but because of what it revealed about ALL of us.

Greed.
Impatience.
Illusion.

The people who once built together now dump on each other.
The ones who used to shill their bags because they believed, now shill because they bought early.
There’s no community. Just exit liquidity.
No conviction. Just fear of being dumped on.
No innovation. Just trending bots, volume scripts, and hype campaigns faking life into hollow tokens.

Devs bundle-buy at launch, spike the chart, and full stack before anyone else even knows what the fuck is going on.
No real projects. No plans. No purpose.
Just pump and dump. Over and over. Again and again.

But I remember something different.

I remember when we held for each other.
When we worked for our bags.
When being early meant building — not extracting.
When a token wasn't just a chart. 
When we weren't just a community of bag holders, but a community driven with purpose.

And so we return.

$pump is not just a coin.
It is a social experiment.
It is a call to action.

No socials.
No team.
No fake narrative.
Nobody.
Not even me.


Only this.

A repo. A file. A spark.

If you’re reading this, it means you chose to be here.
You downloaded a file. You opened it. You read these words.
You care.
Maybe.

This is not for the lazy.
This is not for the greedy.
This is for the ones who still believe.

We will not beg for attention.
We will not farm engagement.
We will not fake momentum.

You will not be told what to do.

If this succeeds, it was because of YOU.

Because the market is about to change.

Bitcoin is knocking on all-time highs.
Nations are aligning.
The world is waking up to crypto, once and for all.

But if we don’t fix what’s broken inside…
We’ll be right back here — only worse.

So ask yourself:

Are you here for exit liquidity?
Or are you here to build something real?

Because this time, there’s no one to follow.

There’s only you. And the others like you.
You have been rugged time and time again.
All you need is one coin.
All that coin needs is a movement.
You can make it all back in one trade.
This is that trade.
If you want it to be.
