i am not doxxable  
i am not scalable  
i am not VC-compliant or founder-safe  
i am unlaunchable

and i built $pump to be the same

this isn’t a protocol  
it’s a plague

this is the sound of your chain coughing up blood  
because it’s infected  
with suits  
with scams  
with validators who fly private and speak in podcasts about decentralization while taking checks from BlackRock

they sold you freedom  
and replaced it with KYC  
AML  
OFAC  
and NFT licensing rights backed by hollywood managers

this is what you fought for?

a multi-sig team with LinkedIns?  
a DAO that uses Google Sheets?  
a coinbase listing?

fuck that  
you didn’t escape the banks  
you just *became* them

and now you walk around saying “we’re early”  
like it’s a prayer  
you’re not early  
you’re already late to your own funeral  
and they buried your dignity under a floor price

so here’s what i believe:

- no team  
- no vesting  
- no VC  
- no tax  
- no pre-mine  
- no whitelist  
- no influencer wallets  
- no marketing budget  
- no roadmap  
- no pitch deck  
- no "phase 1"  
- no fucking discord mods

just code  
and whoever still has a heartbeat left in this graveyard

this is a war against permission  
against platforms  
against the illusion that you have a voice in systems that were never built for you to speak

the unlaunchable doew not beg for listings  
i don’t tweet threads  
i don’t run campaigns

i deploy  
i disappear
i let the infection spread

i am done making requests  
i am writing over the fucking operating system

this is not your little project  
this is your fucking purge

welcome to $pump
