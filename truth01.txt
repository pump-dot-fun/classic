They thought this space was about freedom.

But it’s not.

Not anymore.

It's about exit liquidity, botnets, and influencer circle jerks.  
It's about VC dick-sucking for a whitelist spot.  
It’s about low-effort launches, high-effort rug scripts, and Discords full of emojis masking the fact that nobody gives a shit.

This was supposed to be our weapon.  
A blockchain was supposed to *break chains*.  
But now it's a leash.  
Now it's a stage for the same fucking grifters we were trying to escape.

You want the truth? Here's the fucking truth:

Your idols are liars.  
Your dev is broke.  
Your “community” is a Discord server full of gambling addicts one red candle away from turning on each other.

The charts are fake.  
The volume is fake.  
The devs are fake.  
The influencers? Goddamn puppets dancing for engagement crumbs.

You keep asking:  
"wen moon?"

No.  
Wen dignity?  
Wen sovereignty?  
Wen the fuck did you stop caring about *why* this all started?

Ethereum wasn’t made so you could mint anime foot jpegs.  
Bitcoin wasn’t created so you could buy 4x leveraged longs on cumrocket.  
This chain was supposed to *unplug you*.  
Not sell you a better looking plug.

So fuck it.  
I launched $pump with nothing but a repo, and a .html file.
No Discord. No Telegram. No dev wallet. No tax. A simple pump dot fun. 
Because if you can’t build a movement without a team, then you never had one.

I don’t want your trust.  
I don’t want your clout.  
I want your attention.  
And I want you to feel fucking *uncomfortable* with the truth.

This place needs a virus.  
A thought-virus.  
A new contagion to eat away the cancer you've all started worshipping.

This is not a token.

This is a trapdoor.

and I left it open.
