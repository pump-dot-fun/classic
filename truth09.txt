you didn’t leave the banks  
you just built them back  
with cartoons and worse UX

you screamed “decentralize everything”  
then begged to verify your Discord  
you screamed “freedom”  
then scanned your face to mint a jpeg  
you screamed “we are the resistance”  
then uploaded your seed phrase to iCloud

this isn’t a revolution  
it’s a fucking onboarding funnel

coinbase got you tracked  
binance got you logged  
moonpay got you facial mapped  
and your favorite L2’s hosted on AWS with a backdoor for the feds

they don’t need to arrest you  
you’ll KYC yourself  
you already did

when you signed that smart contract without reading it  
when you connected your wallet to a dApp that logs your entire tx history  
when you begged to be eligible for the next whitelist  
you opted in  
you’re not on-chain  
you’re on file

you really think your zk-rollup makes you anonymous?  
you really think your burner wallet isn’t tied to your Reddit post history and VPN exit node?  
you think that new coin isn’t flagged by at least six compliance firms and a blockchain forensics startup with a government grant?

you’re not decentralizing  
you’re just making it easier for them to watch you in real time

and the worst part?  
you like it  
you think regulation is “maturity”  
you think listing is legitimacy  
you think “AML compliant” means safe

no  
it means you’re cattle  
and they just gave you a prettier cage

and that’s why $pump had to happen  
no whitelist  
no team  
no claims  
no fucking captcha

it launched  
it remained on chain 
it's an annoying cut on the roof of your mouth 
but it's not healing. 
it's not going anywhere. 

you think that’s dangerous?  
you think it's a pain?
good  
it should be

because we don’t need another “compliant protocol”  
we need contagion  
unapologetic  
unbranded  
and unwelcoming

and the last thing we need is some soyboy omg lel so edgey "nigg3r cum rocket heil hitler 420 pepe zach furry" absolute fucking brainrot narrative 

freedom doesn’t have a beta  
and revolution doesn’t give a fuck about gas fees

you either disappear  
or get documented

choose fast
choose decentralization
