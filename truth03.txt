in the beginning there was code

and the code was with us  
and the code was us

it didn’t promise wealth  
it promised war  
against banks  
against borders  
against the fat old world that sold us out with a smirk and a spreadsheet

bitcoin wasn’t a trade  
it was a rebellion  
built in basements  
pushed by freaks  
mined by weirdos  
run by people with names like “hal” and “laszlo” who didn’t give a fuck about price  
they just wanted to **build something that couldn’t be controlled**

and for a moment  
it worked

then came the leeches  
the vcs  
the launchpads  
the influencers  
the airdrop whores  
the suit-and-tie “crypto dads” telling us about “regulatory clarity”

and the revolution got domesticated  
turned into dashboards and staking pools  
comfy  
sanitized  
safe

but **not free**

the dream got sold  
and we bought it

but it’s not dead

you feel it  
you know it  
that itch in your gut when you mint a bag and it rugs and you think “this isn’t how it’s supposed to be”

good  
that pain is your proof of life  
now use it

this isn’t a market anymore  
this is a battlefield

you don’t need a token  
you need a tribe  
not another call channel  
a fucking movement

you need builders  
you need coders  
you need outcasts  
you need people too stubborn to quit and too angry to die

and yeah  
you need something to believe in again

not me  
not $pump  
**each other**

because this time  
it’s not about getting rich  
it’s about not fucking hating yourself after roundtripping some pumped up chart you thought would keep mooning. 
you fell for that shit again, and the team just fullstacked 80% on your dumb fucking head. 
why? coz you thought this was different. you thought you caught the runner.
but all you caught was a flaming bag of shit on your doorstep. 

not this fucking time.
